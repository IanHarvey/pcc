In regards to the Caldera licensing, read Why Caldera Released Unix: A Brief History and their ``Dear UNIX enthusiasts'' letter in HTML or PDF format. See the PCC History page for other details.

To keep the license flora on a reasonable level, it is recommended that new code uses a traditional 2-clause (or less) BSD license.
