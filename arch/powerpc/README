On OS X, binaries are not ELF and all binaries are compiled PIC.  To use pcc
on OS X while linking against the system libraries, use the -k option.

Current issues:

- no floating point
- mod/div on longlong not supported
- problems with static variables with PIC
- the stack frame is always 200 bytes - need to calculate size and patch
  OREGs to temporaries and arguments
- function arguments are always saved to the stack
- permanent registers >R13 are not saved
- structure arguments don't work
- return of structure doesn't work
- no built-in vararg support
