.Sh NAME
.Nm cc
.Nd front-end to the C compiler
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl TODO
.Op infile...
.Pp
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility provides a front-end to the PCC C compiler.
Multiple files may be given on the command line.
Unrecognized options are all sent directly to
.Xr ld 1 .
.Pp
.\" Brief description of its syntax:
Filenames that end with
.Sy .c
are passed via
.Xr cpp 1 ->
.Xr ccom 1 ->
.Xr as 1 ->
.Xr ld 1 .
.Pp
Filenames that end with
.Sy .s
are passed via
.Xr as 1 ->
.Xr ld 1 .
.Pp
Filenames that end with
.Sy .o
are passed directly to
.Xr ld 1 .
.Pp
.\" TODO: document when -D__ASSEMBLER__ ??
.\" TODO:  document __PCC__, __PCC_MINOR__, and __PCC_MINORMINOR__
.\"
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl B Ar prefix
Define alternate prefix path for
.Xr cpp 1 ,
.Xr ccom 1 ,
.Xr as 1 ,
or
.Xr ld 1
executables.
.\" TODO: provide an example of -B
.It Fl c
Only compile or assemble and then stop.
Do not link.
Note: cannot be combined with
.Fl o
if multiple files are given.
.It Fl d
Sent to assembler. TODO?
.It Fl E
Stop after preprocessing with
.Xr cpp 1 .
Do not compile, assemble, or link.
.It Fl fPIC
Generate PIC code.
See
.Fl k
option.
.\" other -f GCC compatibility flags are ignored for now
.It Fl g
Send
.Fl g
flag to
.Xr ccom 1
to create debug output.
.It Fl include Ar path
.\" TODO
.It Fl isystem Ar path
.\" TODO
.It Fl k
Tells C compiler to generate PIC code
and tells assembler that PIC code has been generated.
.It Fl L
.\" TODO
.It Fl M
Pass
.Fl M
flag to
.Xr cpp 1
to generate dependencies for
.Xr make 1 .
.It Fl nostdinc
.\" TODO
.It Fl nostdlib
.\" TODO
.\" implies -nostartfiles ??
.It Fl nostartfiles
.\" TODO
.It Fl o Ar outfile
Save result to
.Ar outfile .
.It Fl P
TODO: what is this?
.It Fl pg
Not implemented.
.It Fl O
.\" TODO: sets -xtemps for ccom??
Note: this is unset if
.Fl g
option is set.
.It Fl pthread
Defines
.Sy _PTHREADS
preprocessor directive for
.Xr cpp 1 .
Uses
.Sy -lpthread
for
.Xr ld 1 linker.
.It Fl static
Do not use dynamic linkage.
By default, it will link using the dynamic linker options
and/or shared objects for the platform.
.It Fl S
Stop after compilation by
.Xr ccom 1 .
Do not assemble and do not link.
Note: cannot be combined with
.Fl o
if multiple files are given.
.It Fl t
Passes
.Fl t
to
.Xr cpp 1
for traditional C preprocessor syntax.
.It Fl v
Outputs the version of
.Nm
and shows what commands will be ran with their command line arguments.
.It Fl x
TODO
.It Fl X
TODO
.It Fl Wl Ar flags
Options for the linker
.\" what is ignored? llist?
.\" TODO: DIUC options?
