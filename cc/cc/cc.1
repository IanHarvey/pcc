.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility provides a front-end to the
.Dq portable C compiler.
Multiple files may be given on the command line.
Unrecognized options are all sent directly to
.Xr ld 1 .
.Pp
.\" Brief description of its syntax:
Filenames that end with
.Sy .c
are passed via
.Xr cpp 1 ->
.Xr ccom 1 ->
.Xr as 1 ->
.Xr ld 1 .
.Pp
Filenames that end with
.Sy .s
are passed via
.Xr as 1 ->
.Xr ld 1 .
.Pp
Filenames that end with
.Sy .o
are passed directly to
.Xr ld 1 .
.Pp
.\"
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl B Ar prefix
Define alternate prefix path for
.Xr cpp 1 ,
.Xr ccom 1 ,
.Xr as 1 ,
or
.Xr ld 1
executables.
.\" TODO: provide an example of -B
.It Fl c
Only compile or assemble and then stop.
Do not link.
Note: cannot be combined with
.Fl o
if multiple files are given.
.It Fl d Ar option
Passed to the
.Xr as 1
assembler.
.\" TODO: what is as -dfoo for?
.It Fl D Ar macro[=value]
Passed to the
.Xr cpp 1
preprocessor to define
.Ar macro .
.It Fl E
Stop after preprocessing with
.Xr cpp 1 .
Do not compile, assemble, or link.
.It Fl fPIC
Generate PIC code.
See
.Fl k
option.
.\" other -f GCC compatibility flags are ignored for now
.It Fl g
Send
.Fl g
flag to
.Xr ccom 1
to create debug output.
This unsets the
.Fl O
option.
.It Fl include Ar path
.\" TODO
.It Fl isystem Ar path
.\" TODO
.It Fl k
Tells C compiler to generate PIC code
and tells assembler that PIC code has been generated.
.It Fl I Ar path
Passed to the
.Xr cpp 1
preprocessor to add header search directory to override system defaults.
.It Fl L
.\" TODO
.It Fl M
Pass
.Fl M
flag to
.Xr cpp 1
to generate dependencies for
.Xr make 1 .
.It Fl nostdinc
.\" TODO
.It Fl nostdlib
.\" TODO
.\" implies -nostartfiles ??
.It Fl nostartfiles
.\" TODO
.It Fl o Ar outfile
Save result to
.Ar outfile .
.It Fl P
TODO: what is this?
.\" TODO: Looks like it does cpp only, but I couldn't get it to work for me.
.It Fl pg
Not implemented.
.It Fl O
Enable optimizations.
Currently passes
.Fl xtemps
to
.Xr ccom 1 .
Note: this is unset if
.Fl g
option is set.
.It Fl pthread
Defines
.Sy _PTHREADS
preprocessor directive for
.Xr cpp 1 .
Uses
.Sy -lpthread
for
.Xr ld 1 linker.
.It Fl static
Do not use dynamic linkage.
By default, it will link using the dynamic linker options
and/or shared objects for the platform.
.It Fl S
Stop after compilation by
.Xr ccom 1 .
Do not assemble and do not link.
The resulting assembler-language output is saved
with a filename with
.Dq .s
suffix.
Note: cannot be combined with
.Fl o
if multiple files are given.
.It Fl t
Passes
.Fl t
to
.Xr cpp 1
for traditional C preprocessor syntax.
.It Fl U Ar macro
Passed to the 
.Xr cpp 1
preprocessor to remove the initial macro definition.
.It Fl v
Outputs the version of
.Nm
and shows what commands will be ran with their command line arguments.
.It Fl x
TODO
.It Fl X
TODO
.It Fl Wl Ar flags
Options for the linker
.\" what is ignored? llist?
.El
.Sh Predefined Macros  
A few
macros are predefined by
.Nm
went sent to
.Xr cpp 1 .
.Bl -diag
.\" TODO:
.\" .It __ASSEMBLER__
.\" Defined if suffix is .S -- why not with .s? what does this mean?
.It __PCC__
Set to the major version of
.Xr pcc 1 .
These macros can be used to select code based on
.Xr pcc 1
compatibility.
See
.Fl v
option.
.It __PCC_MINOR__
Set to the minor version.
.It __PCC_MINORMINOR__
Set to the minor-minor version -- the number after the minor version.
.It _PTHREADS
Defined when
.Fl pthread
switch is used.
.El
.Pp
Also system and/or machine dependent macros may also be defined,
such as:
.Dv __NetBSD__
and
.Dv __i386__ .
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr as 1 ,
.Xr ccom 1 ,
.Xr cpp 1 ,
.Xr ld 1
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
command comes from the original Portable C Compiler by S. C.
Johnson, written in the late 70's.
