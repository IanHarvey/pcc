.Sh NAME
.Nm ccom
.Nd C compiler
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl gkps
.Op Fl W Ar warnings
.Op Fl X Ar flags
.Op Fl x Ar settings
.Op Fl Z Ar flags
.Op infile
.Op outfile
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility provides a C compiler.
The frontend is usually
.Xr pcc 1 .
It is
.Em not
intended to be run directly.
.Pp
.Nm
reads the C source from
.Ar infile
or standard input and writes the assembler source
to
.Ar outfile
or to standard output.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl g
Enable debugging.
.\" built into binary, explain stabs?
.It Fl k
Generate PIC code.
.It Fl p
Generate profiling code.
.It Fl s
Print statistics to standard error when complete.
This includes:
name table entries, name string size, permanent allocated memory,
temporary allocated memory, lost memory, argument list unions,
dimension/function unions, struct/union/enum blocks, inline node count,
inline control blocks, and permanent symtab entries.
.\" TODO: explain units for above?
.It Fl v
Display version.
.It Fl W Ar warning
Do some basic checks and emit warnings about possible coding problems.
Multiple
.Fl W
options can be given, the following warnings are supported:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Sy error
Treat all warnings as errors.
.It Sy implicit-function-declaration
(TODO) Require explicit prototypes for all called functions.
.It Sy implicit-int
(TODO) Warn when a function declaration lacks a type.
.It Sy missing-prototypes
Require explicit prototypes for all global function definitions.
.It Sy pointer-sign
Warn when pointer operations are done with mismatched signed and unsigned values.
.It Sy sign-compare
(TODO) Warn about comparisons between signed and unsigned values.
.It Sy strict-prototypes
(TODO) Require that function prototypes are strictly C99.
.It Sy shadow
Report when a local variable shadows something from a higher scope.
.It Sy truncate
Report when integer values may be implicitly truncated to fit a smaller type.
.It Sy unknown-pragmas
Report unhandled pragma statements.
.It Sy unreachable-code
Report statements that cannot be executed.
.El
.\"
.It Fl X Ar flags
C specific debugging where
.Ar flags
is one or more of the following:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Sy b
Building of parse trees
.It Sy d
Declarations (using multiple
.Sy d
flags gives more output)
.It Sy e
Pass1 trees at exit
.It Sy i
Initializations
.It Sy n
Memory allocations
.It Sy o
Turn off optimisations
.It Sy p
Prototypes
.It Sy s
Inlining
.It Sy t
Type conversions
.It Sy x
Target-specific flag, used in machine-dependent code
.El
.\"
.It Fl x Ar setting
Enable
.Ar setting
in the compiler.
Multiple
.Fl x
options can be given, the following settings are supported:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Sy ccp
Apply sparse conditional constant propagation techniques for optimization.
Currently not implemented.
.It Sy dce
Do dead code elimination.
.It Sy deljumps
Delete redundant jumps and dead code.
.It Sy gcc
Use gcc semantics rather than C99 for some things.
Currently only inline.
.It Sy inline
Replace calls to functions marked with an inline specifier with a copy
of the actual function.
.It Sy ssa
Convert statements into static single assignment form for optimization.
Not yet finished.
.It Sy tailcall
Enable optimization of tail-recursion functions.
Currently not implemented.
.It Sy temps
Locate automatic variables into registers where possible, for further
optimization by the register allocator.
.El
.\"
.It Fl Z Ar flags
Code generator (pass2) specific debugging where
.Ar flags
is one or more of the following:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Sy b
Basic block and SSA building
.It Sy c
Code printout
.It Sy e
Trees when entering pass2
.It Sy f
Instruction matcher, may provide much output
.It Sy n
Memory allocation
.It Sy o
Instruction generator
.It Sy r
Register allocator
.It Sy s
Shape matching in instruction generator
.It Sy t
Type matching in instruction generator
.It Sy u
Sethi-Ullman computations
.It Sy x
Target-specific flag, used in machine-dependent code

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
compiler is based on the original Portable C Compiler by S. C. Johnson,
written in the late 70's.
Even though much of the compiler has been rewritten, some of the
basics still remain.
About 50% of the frontend code and 80% of the backend code has been
rewritten.
Most is written by Anders Magnusson, with the exception of
the data-flow analysis part and the SSA conversion code which is
written by Peter A Jonsson, and the Mips port that were written as
part of a project by undergraduate students at Lulea University of
Technology.
